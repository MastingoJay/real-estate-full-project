# üìå Overview

This project was developed for a real estate firm in Kenya aiming to uncover insights into property trends, pricing, and data completeness. Using Power BI, a comprehensive dashboard was created to support data-driven decision-making across property development and marketing strategies.

The dashboard addresses key business questions:

- Which areas have the highest priced homes?

- How do the number of bedrooms or bathrooms affect pricing?

- What are the most common property sizes?

- Which listings are incomplete (e.g., missing size data)?

To meet these goals, the visuals focus on:

1. Location-Based Price Analysis ‚Äì Identifies premium markets like Runda and Nyali to guide investment.

2. Bedroom-to-Price Comparison ‚Äì Reveals how property features impact value and customer targeting.

3. Data Quality Checks ‚Äì Highlights incomplete listings to drive listing improvements.

4. Price Distribution ‚Äì Shows price ranges and outliers to support competitive pricing.

5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) ‚Äì Provides metrics like average price and total listings to track market activity.
